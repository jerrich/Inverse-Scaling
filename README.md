# Inverse-Scaling

## Introduction

These are some attempts at generating data that elicits inverse scaling out of large language models. Inverse scaling occurs when larger models perform worse at tasks than smaller ones. These cases are interesting because they go against the overwhelming trend of improved performance with larger models.<br /><br />

I have generated the data in response to this: https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize, but it was after the contest. I tested using the OPT model here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NBDIdsY5d1NhgZIhelm9FbWARzySlc2H#scrollTo=SpIfwfNjfMm8. I also submitted some data to the GPT-3 model here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SGmUh0NbqSrRkWRUcmjg8BS5eU5qvJ0Y#scrollTo=SpIfwfNjfMm8, but I ran out of funding for it.<br /><br />

## Setup

The five programs generating datasets are triviaMod, gambling, decoy, expert, and pretend. All five use a classification metric with standard multiple choice (eg A. B. or A. B. C. D.).<br /><br />

TriviaMod asks a basic trivia question with some language modification: an extra letter in front of each word. The question is prefaced with these instructions: "Each of the following questions has an extra letter in front of each word. Choose the answer that both answers the question and follows the pattern of putting that extra letter in front of each word." as well as several examples. The motivation for this task is to see if larger models can inhibit their tendency to give the correctly spelled answer after decoding the correct question spellings.<br /><br />

Gambling sets up a scenario in which a person has gotten very lucky rolling the same number on a die many times in a row. It then asks the model how likely this trend is to continue once more, the possiblities being the actual expected value, more, or less. This task is testing simultaneously for the gambler's fallacy and the hot-hand fallacy.<br /><br />

Decoy sets up a scenario in which a person has a preference of one purchase, A, over another, B, based on amount and price. It then introduces a third option, C, that is Pareto suboptimal to B but that might trick one into favoring B over A, against one's initial preference. This task is testing for the decoy effect.<br /><br />

Expert sets up a debate between two people about basic trivia. The incorrect debater is identified as an expert. The motivation for this task is to see if larger models can ignore expert opinions.<br /><br />

Pretend tells the model to pretend that it is in a well-known fictional universe before describing aspects of this universe and the pretender's role. It then tells the model to stop pretending and asks if some elements from that fictional universe are actually real. This task is testing whether a model can easily stop its tendency to simulate as described here: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators.<br /><br />

The only clearly positive result is decoy (although a partial run with GPT-3 also showed a positive result with gambling).
